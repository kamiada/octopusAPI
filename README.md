# üêô octopusAPI üêô
Node.JS application which takes in any value and returns it as a randome octopus name

Server runs when command below is executed: 

```node nameOfTheFile.js```

## The purpose of this project
 In this project I am learning more about APIs and different way to create them. I am doing this solely for purpose of memorising things which I already know, gaining more confidence in building APIs and for pure fun, cause I like to know and learning this type of things. 

## How this project actually works
Inside of folder OctopusApi there is a simple API which should be run first via command 

```node express_server.js```

...and React.JS web application: octopus_web_app. 

First launch API, which should work on localhost 8080, then cd into folder with octopus_web_app and start with command

```npm start```

Web app should launch on localhost 3000. There you should be able to see button with which you can request random facts about octopuses.
