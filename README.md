# octopusAPI
Node.JS application which takes in any value and returns it as a randome octopus name

Server runs when command below is executed: 

```node nameOfTheFile.js```

## The purpose of this project
 In this project I am learning more about APIs and different way to create them. I am doing this solely for purpose of memorising things which I already know, gaining more confidence in building APIs and for pure fun, cause I like to know and learning this type of things.
